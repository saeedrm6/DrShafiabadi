Thank you immensly bdbrown!

After reading through your links and researching on my own for all day I was almost able to solve both questions.

First I came up with the following code that works great for displaying the number of posts within a the regular category Premium Archive:

<?php
$args = array(
    'cat' => 173
);
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args );
echo $the_query->found_posts;
?>

I could also display all posts within the post type “recipe” with the following code:

<?php
$args = array(
  'tag__in' => '146',
  'post_type' => 'recipe'
);
$the_query = new WP_Query( $args );
echo $the_query->found_posts;
?>

However I am unable to specify the recipe type as premium-recipes since WP_Query doesn’t recognize the slug ‘premium-recipes’ or tag_ID=146.
You’ve been a great help so far, do you have any other suggestions that will allow me to specify the type of recipe that is counted?
